# the pillows "yeah" counter Chart

**the pillows** are a Japanese alternative rock band formed in 1989. The singer **Sawao Yamanaka** uses the catch-phrase '**Oh Yeah!**' countless times during shows, and in many songs.

Therefore, I'll breakdown several charts that counts the number of every 'oh yeah' of all his songs. To simplify this measurement, I'll only count the times he says '**yeah**', and not 'oh yeah' as a whole word.

**OH YEAH?** ðŸŽ¸
