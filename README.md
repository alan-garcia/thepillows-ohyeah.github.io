# the pillows 'yeah' counter Chart

**the pillows** are a Japanese alternative rock band formed in 1989. The singer **Sawao Yamanaka** uses the catch-phrase '**Oh Yeah!**' countless times during shows, and in many songs.

Therefore, I'll breakdown several charts that counts the number of every 'oh yeah' of all his songs. To simplify this measurement, **I'll only count the times he says 'yeah', and not 'oh yeah' as a whole word**.

**OH YEAH?** ðŸŽ¸

> Good music has no borders, no race, and is timeless!
> â€” Sawao Yamanaka
